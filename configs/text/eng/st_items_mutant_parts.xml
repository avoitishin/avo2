From the remains of their clothing we can deduce that izloms originate from prisoner population that was stationed the Exclusion Zone and sentenced for forced labor. Since the deformation of the body is almost identical in case of all izloms, it is supposed that when the exposure took place all subjects were in the same body position - either because they were in the process of being transported or because someone purposely placed them so. All specimens encountered so far were male and sterile. Hence it can be safely assumed that the izlom population is unable to reproduce, and their number in the Zone is steadily getting lower. For this reason, at present date they remain one of the most rarely encountered type of mutant, and highly deformed, right hand of an izlom constitutes a valuable research object.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] mutated body part\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] rare scientific specimen\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] valuable</text>

		<text>An eye of the pseudogiant has the appearance of a larger human eye, but with a few differences. It has a multi-colored iris and its tear glands are exceptionally well developed. Pseudogiants are known to lacrimate profusely and regularly, but we don't know whether this is a result of some physiological process or a by-product of the psychology of the creature. In any case, the scientists would be very eager to lay their hands on it, so they're willing to pay a high price for any specimen.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] mutated body part\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] very rare scientific specimen\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] valuable</text>

		<text>A mutated beak from a crow that has lived for more than 15 years in the Zone. Extremely durable and hard. The majority of stalkers consider crows as pests that are to be disposed of, while others acknowledge their usefulness when navigating through the empty streets of Chernobyl and Pripyat. Beaks are sometimes worn as jewelry, but are of not much use besides that. However, there is a rumor that the very first stalkers that arrived in the Zone came up with a ritual that they aptly named "the Beak."\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] mutated body part\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] rare scientific specimen\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] valuable</text>
