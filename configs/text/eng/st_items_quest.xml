However, it didn't withstand the passage of time well and only a small part of the text is legible:\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]"There was talk about this anomaly, reportedly located deep inside a cave or fissure in the ground. There were supposed to be crazy amounts of artifacts, but for some reason nobody wanted to go there. "Cowards and fools," we thought. Why the hell wouldn't anyone jump at the chance to get rich, and live an easy life ever after? So we felt this sudden surge of courage, packed up, and went directly to the cave. We didn't even manage to peer into the cave, and this dark shadow flew over us. I tripped, struck my head when I feel, and just blacked out. After a while I came to, and heard something or someone moaning. "Animals,” I thought at first, but then I realized that it was my friend lying in front of me. I saw his skin ripped all over his body, saw his muscles bleeding all over and saw the bones sticking from disgusting wounds. He was clumsily holding his now exposed guts with his hand, while he was crawling further out of the cave. It was miracle he didn't die on the spot. "What the hell happened?," I couldn't make sense of anything. I still had my backup pistol, and by a defense mechanism of some sort I started shooting towards the darkness of the cave. I had 20 rounds in that pistol, and switched to single fire. When I still had 7 rounds, something grabbed my hand, and made me pull the trigger. At that time I didn't even realize where my gun was pointed and where I was shooting but I couldn't stop. And suddenly the force let go of me, but I was in such a shock that I kept pulling the trigger a few minutes after the magazine was already empty. I knew if I had stopped, I'd have had to face what I did to my friend. I didn't even have the courage to take his dog tags. I just ran. How could I talk to someone or have another friend, when the Zone could take them too? It's better to be alone. Friendship comes with a price and a risk. The short-lived warmth of friendship is not worth it, if you could lose that friendship in the worst imaginable way. I have this bump on my head now to remind me of that.

If that farmstead didn't exist, Skadovsk would be overrun by boars in a matter of days. No amount of ammo could keep them at bay, if it wasn't for the Burnt Farmstead, this barbecue factory.

However, field trials have proven that - for reasons as of yet unknown to science - they are capable of simple mechanical reactions (reminiscent of instinct, but their logic substantially differs). One theory states that this is the result of a never ending neurochemical barrage that compels the body to move in a specific manner in response to certain stimuli. When threatened, they demonstrate extremely violent behavior, so it is advisable to approach them with great care and caution. As far as their physiology is concerned, out test have revealed a peculiar - and potentially scientifically fruitful - ability to self-sustain body parts, which means that such parts are able to function even when separated from the main body and without access to any nutrients whatsoever. One of the most successful endeavors of the scientific team entailed sustaining a liver and a heart for over 3 months despite them being not connected to other organs and bloodstream.

This also applies to the use of other tools and some of the less complicated devices.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Please abstain from using the terms "kill" or "destroy" when referring to the deactivation of a specimen. This stems from the psychological argument that the term "deactivation" is more neutral than "destruction", and can serve as a way of distancing ourselves from the seemingly human form they manage to maintain and of suppressing the feeling of remorse after "deactivating" a specimen. Deactivation requires physically severing the link to their motor system. This would entail inflicting damage to the brain or spinal area, preferably by means of ballistic trauma. Every member of the scientific team should bear in mind that their limbs will remain mobile even after deactivation, therefore special precautions are advised. Especially effective is the physical removal of cervical vertebrae or brain stem with surgical instruments or, in case of their unavailability, any sharp object.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] scientific item\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] personal belongings\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] usable for:%c[0,170,170,170] weapon maintenance (+2%)</text>

Neuropsychologists are an especially interested party due to the potential for brain stem transplants that could theoretically aid patients in late stages of Alzheimer's and other diseases.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Whenever possible, avoid damaging kidneys and heart upon deactivation as these organs possess immense potential provided transplants ever prove viable. Harvesting organs from immobile "zombies" is also a possibility, however it is recommended to be cautious of local stalkers who might have emotional ties to some specimens. If an encounter with a stalker is unavoidable while harvesting, there are two courses of action one can take in order to minimize the chance of combat. First, when dealing with inexperienced stalkers showing them the eyes of a given specimen has proven very effective, especially since the pupils are completely unresponsive and the eyeballs as such appear inhuman. Secondly, more seasoned stalkers are usually easier to be reasoned with as they can suppress emotions better. However, it is still advisable to make us of psychological expertise when dealing with local human population as in some cases rational communication is completely out of the question.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] scientific item\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] personal belongings\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] usable for:%c[0,170,170,170] weapon maintenance (+2%)</text>

Only here can I really feel the bonds with other people. Only here can I see them for who they truly are. There are no masks here, only truth. But, like I said, I'll tell you more next time we meet. I've earned some good money here! We can finally buy you that necklace you wanted so much. Oh, and thank you for your letters. They really lift my spirits. When I think about you, everything seems a lot better. We will meet each other soon. Say hello to the kids for me!\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Lots of love. Your Michail.

		<text>A note found in a stash. It is difficult to determine why it was written in the first place. Most probably, someone was killing time during a long and boring night and then decided to leave the result of his work behind rather than throw it into the campfire. The text of the note reads:\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]"Oh yeah. I'm a Military Stalker. This is something unbelievable. Best equipment. Best objectives. Best weapons. Best everything! Finally we've called a truce between the military and the Stalkers. We don't have to shoot each other for once. And this is great - we all are Slavs so we should stick together. What about marauders? Fuck those motherfuckers! It's always great to put a bullet right between their eyes. I'm just a noob here, in this squad, but I already feel that I've become a real man - strong and important.

However, we can choose what we do and what we don't. Sometimes we don't even apply for a certain job because it is too "dirty" for us. If the client wants to kill some good folks earning a living by sweat and toil - fuck this bastard. They always can go to the Zone and deal with their problems themselves. What about marauders, deserters and other scumbags - always yours. Any time, any place. When we have to PROTECT ourselves - it's another matter. But if you want to kill an innocent man - ask those American dolls. They're not so choosy as who to kill. We're different.

		<text>A printed transcription of the radio transmission between military units stationed in the Zone. The fact that it was in possession of one of the SKAT unit members indicates that he must have been involved in a clandestine operation, most probably concerned with the extraction of surveillance data. The transcription reads:\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]"- HQ, this is MSRC 1-03. We've got photos of NII. 240 photos of an anomaly in the Swamps, about 1400 photos of the main base. When do we return?\n%c[0,170,170,170]- MSRC 1-03, this is HQ. Do not come back for now. There are some problems at the Military Warehouses. MSRC 4-07 is asking for help. Again. This time, however, their SOS signal is strong so we at least know that they are alive.\n%c[0,170,170,170]- Eh, roger that, HQ. Chopper?\n%c[0,170,170,170]- Negative. There are too many anomaly fields in NII Agroprom now, it's too dangerous. Go to Yantar, our MI-24 will pick you up there.\n%c[0,170,170,170]- Roger. Any information about the next blowout?\n%c[0,170,170,170]- Positive. Sacharov said that there are two days left at least. But hurry anyway. Their information has never been reliable.\n%c[0,170,170,170]- Understood. We are on our way, tell the Bird to be at Yantar in 7 hours. MSRC 1-03 out.\n%c[0,170,170,170]- Wait, 1-03. What about the underground in N-2? Did you find anything there?\n%c[0,170,170,170]- Positive. We have found that new anomaly. It looks like some sort of teleport. This should be interesting for those bigheads from Yantar, our detectors fried when we tried to measure psi-fields. Dunno why, possibly because of electronic waves.\n%c[0,170,170,170]- Roger that, MSRC 1-03. Good luck on your way to Yantar. Hear from you in 7 hours.

		<text>Letter to Nicolai</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_letter_stalker_letter_3_desc">
		<text>A hand-written letter addressed to Nicolai. Most probably a part of a longer written conversation between two stalkers. Although correspondence in the Zone is conducted mainly by means of PDA messages, some prefer a traditional manner of communication, especially in case of most private matters and between friends. These letters are then handed to couriers who, like guides, are entrusted with some of the most difficult and dangerous tasks. It often takes a few days before a letter reaches its recipient, but still the probability of intercepting the message is much lower than in case of PDA communication. The courier profession is highly regarded among fellow stalkers and entails a position of significant influence in the stalker community. The letter reads:\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]"Nicolai,\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]I've just gotten back from my trip to the center of the Zone. It was hell. The Monolith and the army are still going at it, bent on exterminating each other for no reason. One moment it looked like they would conclude a cease-fire, but eventually nothing came of it. Constant havoc and destruction followed and I didn't have any other choice but to escape from this place. I almost got killed once, freaking psycho bastards -but I don't  blame them, entirely my fault, I just wasn't paying attention when it mattered most. This way or another, after some hardships, I made my way to Pripyat and I plan to lie low here for a while. Getting back to what we discussed previously, it seems like we're gonna have to put off our mission until it gets safer out there. I didn't get a moment of sleep after I got back, but I wanted to let you know I'm good, at least physically. We'll stay in touch.\n \n%c[0,170,170,170]Take good care, Rua"\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,255,255] • %c[0,140,140,140] personal belongings\n%c[255,238,153,26] • %c[0,140,140,140] usable for:%c[0,170,170,170] weapon maintenance (+1%)</text>
